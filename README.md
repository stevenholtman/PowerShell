# PowerShell Readme 💻
Welcome to my <a href="https://github.com/stevenholtman">@stevenholtman</a> repository for PowerShell Scripts for Network Administration

I have compiled several of my scripts that I have developed over the years as a Network Engineer to make available conviently for IT Administrators or anyone who is interested in learning more about powershell and automation.

I configured the scripts to use variables as much as possible to make them universal and/or update for any domain enviorment, so if you are in a workgroup or in a domain enviorment if the script pertains you will be able to quickly start utilizing it.
